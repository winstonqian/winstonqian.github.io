I'm an senior at University of California, Berkeley, pursuing simultaneous degrees in Data Science (B.A.) and Chemistry (B.S.). I'm broadly interested in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning for high-impact problems in molecular modeling and drug discovery.

At UC Berkeley, I am an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">BAIR</a> in Professor Krishnapriyan's Lab, where I worked on advancing solutions in molecular dynamics and weather forecasting using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
I also contributed to fusing advanced deep learning and 3D molecular models for transformative drug discovery at <a href="https://www.merck.com/" target="_blank">Merck & Co.</a>

In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis with the <a href="https://calttc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cal Table Tennis Team</a> and staying active at the gym with friends.
